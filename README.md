# Pony-Game-
I am creating a web game using HTML CSS and JavaScript.- It is a work in progress
 So far I  have the basic lay out of the page , the buttons ( i will eventually add a left and right button for more freedom and movability)
This is the first web game i am building with JavaScript and Im hoping to expand and develop it as my knowledge also increases
